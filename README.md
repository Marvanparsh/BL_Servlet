# BL_Servlet
This repository contains two main learning exercises: Simple Java Web Server – A basic web server that responds to HTTP requests. Simple Login Servlet – A servlet handling user login with regex-based validation. The login servlet is designed to accept user credentials. A username and password are entered through an HTML form. The servlet processes these inputs and validates them using a regex pattern. If the credentials match the expected format, access is granted; otherwise, the login attempt is rejected. The servlet runs on a local web server and interacts with client-side inputs.
